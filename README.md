### Project
**Feedback** - 
Very good work. 
Excellent use of graphics.
The use of the LH method was very interesting.
However, I did not see any explanation of the LH method.
Please send me something about the LH method, so I understand it better.
I think the conclusion could have been stronger and more clearly written.
The SAS coding was well organized, interesting, and well thought out.
Overall, the work was very thoroughly and argued for a recommendation with supporting details.
